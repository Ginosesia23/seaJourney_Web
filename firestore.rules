/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SeaJourney Landing Website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated testimonials. Only the authenticated user can create, read, update, or delete their own profile data and testimonials.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}/profile`.
 * - Testimonials are stored as subcollections under user profiles at `/users/{userId}/profile/testimonials/{testimonialId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed as there is no top-level collection of users.
 * - Read-only collections are not applicable in this data model.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled by user ownership, enforced by matching the authenticated user's UID against the document path.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User profiles and testimonials are secured by their path, which includes the userId. This avoids the need for extra `get()` calls to verify ownership.
